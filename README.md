Dietary Recommender 
I developed a dietary recommender system to suggest fast food menu items based on nutritional preferences. I used Python, SQLite and SQL.
•	Data Handling: Imported and processed database using Pandas.
•	Database Management: Created and managed an SQLite database.
•	SQL Queries: Implemented SQL queries to filter items based on carbs and protein.
•	User Interaction: Developed a CLI for user input on dietary preferences.
•	Recommendations: Recommended personalized menu for the user.
